# EQDS Certification

Vendors can certify their systems as **EQDS Compliant**.

## Process
1. Validate your JSON bundles using the [EQDS Validator](https://github.com/EQDS/validator).
2. Submit test data + certification application.
3. If approved, you will receive:
   - A **badge** (e.g., "EQDS Certified 2025")
   - Listing on the [Certified Vendors](vendors.md) page.

Annual renewal is optional, but badges include the certification year.
